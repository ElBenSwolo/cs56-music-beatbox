 Assessment of cs56-music-beatbox
 
 a) Description:
    A gui that has the ability to use the MIDI system to create a sequence of sounds from instruments and has 
    the ability to increase or decrease the tempo of the sequence.
 
 b) User Stories:
    As a user of cs56-music-beatbox I am able to check any of the checkboxes from 16 instrument rows and create a 
    sequence of 16 sounds. Pressing the Start button plays the sequence sound in a loop however, the sequence sound 
    is not added/removed dynamically so you must press start again to play an updated sequence sound. Pressing the Stop 
    button stops the sequence sound. When pressing the stop button it "stops" the sound near the sound in the sequence 
    at which you pressed the stop button (due to some lag). When you press the Start button again it will start at the sound right 
    after the sound at which you stopped. So pressing Start doesn't always start from the beginning sound in the sequence.(*1)
    Pressing the Tempo Up button increases the tempo of the sequence sound dynamically while pressing the Tempo Down button 
    decreases it dynamically. After pressing the sendIt button this message is displayed on the terminal: 
    
          [java] Sorry dude. Could not send it to the server.

   After reading the src code I learned that the sendIt button is supposed to attempt to send a message and the checkbox's state 
   to the server. The message it is attempting to send is anything entered into the "chat" box below it. After pressing the
   sendIt button the message is deleted.
   
 c) Brief assessment of whether the software runs:
    The client class runs and brings up the cs56-music-beatbox gui, however it brings this message to the terminal:
    
      compile:

      client:
        
              [java] couldn't connect - you'll have to play alone.
    

The server class does not run and it brings this message to the terminal:

      compile:

      server:

We entered in a number of things and nothing happened.

d) As a user, I can check the different note boxes and have the sounds be added dynamically instead of stopping and starting again. As a user, I can enter the server name and port into a GUI instead of the command line. As a user, I can see images of the instruments next to their names. As a user, I could have some pre-written background beats as samples to help in building my own. As a user, I could have a checkbox that would switch between dynamically and non-dynamically updating the tempo/sounds.
