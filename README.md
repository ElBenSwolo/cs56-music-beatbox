==================

The code creates a very interesting music beatbox. There are two methods that might be difficult to understand which are makeEvent() and makeTrack(). You don't have to understand these two methods to do the project. The thing you have to notice is that there are actually 276 Jcheckboxes in this gui. For the first 16 Jcheckboxes they are used to display the beat. Notice that there is a bug in the project. Specification on the bug has been posted to this link: https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-projects/cs56-music-beatbox/issues/10. When I tried running the program on different computers, the bug came up on some computers. For the other computers the bug is gone for no reason. We have not figured that out but I hope the experience can help you.
