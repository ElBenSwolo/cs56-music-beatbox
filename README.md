cs56-music-beatbox
==================

Beatbox is a java app that utilizes a computer's sound card in order to create a gui that allows you to manipulate different patterns and sounds to create beats, much like a drum machine. It does this through the use of General MIDI. Each instrument is given its own number in General MIDI and this is how the program locates different sounds for this app...Meaning that the result of what sounds come out of which instrument lie soley on the computer's sound card.
